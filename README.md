# Singly Linked List

## Challenge
- a method insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- a method  includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

- a method  toString  which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
insert O(1)
includes O(n)
toString O(n)
