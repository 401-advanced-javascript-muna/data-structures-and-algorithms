# Challenge Summary
- Tree

## Challenge Description
fizzBuzz method  to create a new tree , but the values modified as follows:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
- add O(logn)

- includes O(logn)

- inOrder(),postOrder(),preOrder()  : O(n)

- fizzBuzz() : O(n)
